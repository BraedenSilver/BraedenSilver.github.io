# Contributing to BraedenSilver.github.io

First off, thank you for wanting to enhance the site. The goal is to keep the vibe fierce, honest, and fast. Follow these guidelines so we can ship with confidence.

## ðŸ”§ Ground Rules
- Be respectful and keep feedback constructive.
- Do not copy/paste content from the site elsewhere without respecting the [Anonymized Remix License](LICENSE).
- Never misrepresent yourself as Braeden Silver or claim ownership of their identity.

## ðŸ›  Development Workflow
1. **Fork** the repo and create your feature branch from `main`.
2. **Install** dependencies if you need build tooling. This site is static, so a local server (Python, Node `serve`, etc.) is usually enough.
3. **Build & test** your changes locally. Run through the affected pages to ensure there are no regressions.
4. **Commit** using clear messages that explain the why, not just the what.
5. **Open a pull request** using the provided template. Link any relevant issues.

## âœ… Content & Code Standards
- Keep HTML semantic, CSS organized, and JavaScript lean.
- Match existing formatting and naming conventions within folders.
- For blog entries, use the JSON structure documented in the [README](README.md).
- Include screenshots or GIFs for visual changes when possible.

## ðŸ§¾ Pull Requests
Every PR should:
- Have a descriptive title.
- Explain the motivation, the changes made, and any follow-up work.
- Reference related issues using GitHub keywords (`Closes #123`).
- Pass any checks or linters you introduce.

## ðŸ—³ Issues
- Use the templates in [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) when filing bugs or feature requests.
- Provide reproduction steps, screenshots, and expected vs actual behavior.

Thanks for keeping the forge burning hot! ðŸ”¥
