<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering undergraduate at Texas State University with a passion for turning ideas into tangible things. My interests range from low-level firmware and PCB design to high-level interfaces that make technology approachable for everyone. When I'm not in the lab, you can find me sketching out mechanical parts, debugging circuits, or experimenting with new programming languages. These explorations often lead to quirky prototypes, some of which grow into larger endeavors that merge art, engineering, and storytelling. I enjoy sharing what I learn with classmates and the broader maker community through workshops and open-source examples.</p>
<p>You can explore a selection of my <a href="/pages/projects.html">project portfolio</a> and dive into academic <a href="/pages/research.html">research summaries</a> that highlight experiments in embedded systems, signal processing, and robotics. One of my favorite builds is an autonomous drone that maps indoor spaces, while another project turns recycled cardboard into walking dinosaur toys for educational outreach. I also maintain <a href="/pages/historia/index.html">Historia Dinosauralis</a>, a playful side project chronicling the adventures of these creatures. Many of these works are open source and live on my <a href="https://github.com/BraedenSilver" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, where I share code, schematics, and tutorials. Visitors can also find circuit diagrams, development logs, and links to talks or conference posters that explain the lessons learned along the way.</p>
<p>My goals include contributing to sustainable robotics and pursuing graduate research in intelligent systems that help people solve real-world problems. I am always eager to collaborate on new ideas, mentor fellow students, and connect with professionals who share an enthusiasm for inventive engineering. Upcoming plans involve expanding my open-source libraries, documenting more builds, and seeking internships that challenge me to grow as an engineer. If you are curious about my work, want to discuss potential collaborations, or simply wish to say hello, feel free to <a href="/pages/contact.html">get in touch</a> or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/braeden-silver" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>. I'm always reachable and excited to meet new collaborators who believe that learning is a lifelong adventure.</p>
