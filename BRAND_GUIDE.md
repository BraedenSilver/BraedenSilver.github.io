# Brand & Attribution Guardrails

These rules protect the identity of Braeden Silver while still letting you remix the work.

## Be Honest About Origin
- Do not claim or imply that your derivative is the official braedensilver.com site.
- Do not use Braeden Silverâ€™s name, likeness, or personal contact details in ways that could confuse people about who created or operates your derivative.

## Attribution Choices
- Code and content released under CC BY 4.0 require attribution that clearly distinguishes your work from the original.

## Visual Identity
- Feel free to remix colors, layouts, and imagery, but avoid copying personal photography or signatures unless you have explicit permission.

When in doubt, reach out via an issue or the contact links on the live site before shipping.
