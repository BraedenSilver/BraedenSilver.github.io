  "body": "I have wanted a home for my scattered notes for a long time. Instead of waiting for the perfect project or a massive writeup, this blog is going to collect the small wins and interesting detours that show up every day.\n\nThe goal is simple: post at least once a day whenever I have something worth sharing. That might be a firmware trick I learned during a late-night debug session, a PCB layout experiment, or reflections on building tools that make hardware work smoother.\n\nNot everything I enjoy fits neatly into engineering, so I am leaving room for photography studies, thoughts on entrepreneurship, and the occasional video game rabbit hole. If I am curious about it, it belongs here.\n\nThis space is mostly for me, but if someone else stumbles across it, welcome. Here's to showing up consistently and capturing the ideas before they fade.",
