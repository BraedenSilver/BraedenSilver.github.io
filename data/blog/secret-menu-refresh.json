  "body": "I spent today rebuilding the Easter egg triggers that live in the footer. The face down there now watches for a very specific rhythm, and when you nail it the secret menu appears with a little more flair than before.\n\nHere is the new onboarding pitch for anyone poking around the site: click the left eye, then the right eye, then repeat that left-right pattern one more time. The sequence is left-right-left-right on the eyes of the face in the footer. If you are a classic cheat-code enjoyer, the Konami code works too: up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A. Either route drops you straight into the secrets menu.\n\nWhile I was in polishing mode, I rewrote the TXST IEEE Project directions. They were written like lab notes, which is fine for returning members but rough for first-timers. The new version leans on plain phrasing, adds quick explanations for the quirky steps, and links out to context for the campus-specific jargon.",
