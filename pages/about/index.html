      <h1>Read More About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hey there! If you made it to this page you probably wanted more than the
        quick bio on the homepage. Here are a few of the random facts that make
        me, me.
      </p>

      <ul class="about-highlights">
        <li>
          I'm Braeden Silver, a Computer Engineering major at Texas State
          University.
        </li>
        <li>
          I chose Computer Engineering because I wanted to learn how to build my
          own computer&mdash;even if that's basically impossible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dogs make better pets than cats, but cats absolutely win in the cool
          factor. Big cats like lions, tigers, and leopards are even cooler than
          wolves.
        </li>
        <li>
          I love dinosaurs. I even launched a whole section on this site about
          them, but I tapped out after the very first entry about the
          Spinosaurus.
        </li>
        <li>
          Halloween is my favorite holiday because my birthday lands in October.
        </li>
        <li>
          My favorite movie is <em>The Big Lebowski</em>, though I'm a fan of
          movies from pretty much every genre.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm into rhetoric, philosophy, and other supposedly "boring" subjects.
          Words can shape minds and change the world, and engineering students
          don't get nearly enough time with them, so I soak it up when I can.
        </li>
        <li>
          I love cold coffee and can crush a Starbucks Venti in seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm obsessed with stories and history&mdash;whether it's religious
          epics, cowboy legends, pirate tales, or ancient civilizations. I
          probably should have been a history major with a philosophy minor, but
          I chose the money and technical skills route instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          Video games keep me inspired too. Team Fortress 2, Helldivers 2,
          <em>Doom</em> (2016), <em>Doom Eternal</em>, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>,
          the <em>Fallout</em> series, Minecraft, and Terraria are
          just a handful of my favorites&mdash;the full list would stretch for
          miles.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </main>
