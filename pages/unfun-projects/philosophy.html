  <h2>Website Philosophy</h2>

  <p>
    I’ve built and rebuilt my personal website about four different times. Each one was good, 
    sometimes even great. But after looking at the personal pages of professors including 
    some at top institutions, an epiphany hit me: 
  </p>

  <p>
    Raw HTML and JavaScript. Barely any CSS, no animations, no frameworks. Just text and links.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s it. That’s the secret. Most professors don’t bother with design. Their sites are 
    stripped down to the essentials: a bio, research links, and maybe a CV. It’s always 
    readable, always loads instantly, and it never breaks when the trends change.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s why my website looks bare-bones now. No fancy colors, no pictures, no animation. 
    Just plain text and links to the things that matter.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to see the guts of how it’s built, the code is public here:
