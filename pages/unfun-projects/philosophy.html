  <h2>Website Philosophy</h2>

  <p>
    I’ve redesigned my personal website more times than I can count, each version a little better than the last.
    But it wasn’t until I started browsing the personal pages of professors, 
    especially those at top schools that I realized I’d been looking at it all wrong
  </p>

  <p>
    Raw HTML and JavaScript. Barely any CSS, no animations, no frameworks. Just text and links.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s it. Most professors don’t bother with design. Their sites are stripped down to the
    essentials: a bio, research links, and maybe a CV. It’s always readable, loads instantly,
    and doesn’t break when trends change.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s why my website is bare-bones now. No fancy colors, no pictures, no animation.
    Just text and links to the things that matter.
