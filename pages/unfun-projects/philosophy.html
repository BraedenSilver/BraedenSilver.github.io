  <h1>Website Philosophy</h1>

  <p>
    I’ve rebuilt this site more times than I can count. Each version got a little better,
    but it wasn’t until I looked at the personal pages of professors—especially at top schools—
    that it clicked. Their websites are just raw HTML: simple, fast, and permanent.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve borrowed that approach: <strong>plain text, links, and minimal CSS</strong>. 
    No frameworks, no heavy design. It’s meant to be lightweight and always readable.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time, I wanted to keep some of the charm of the old web. 
    Instead of wild color palettes and tiled backgrounds, I use <strong>retro GIFs</strong> 
    to add personality and an <strong>ASCII art logo</strong> because that’s a classic.
  </p>

  <p>
    The result is a mash-up: part professor’s portfolio, part GeoCities throwback. 
    Black and white at its core, but with just enough fun to make it feel alive.
